    "transcription": "Hello Ms. Smith, how are you feeling today? Hello, I’ve been feeling a bit unwell lately. I’m sorry to hear that. Can you describe your symptoms for me? Yes, I’ve had a persistent headache for the past few days. It starts in the morning and sometimes lasts all day. Do you experience any other symptoms like nausea or dizziness? Yes, I feel a bit nauseous and occasionally have dizziness. Have you noticed if anything in particular triggers these headaches or makes them worse? It seems to get worse when I work on the computer for long periods. Okay, have you tried taking any medication for the headaches? Yes, I’ve taken over-the-counter pain relievers, but they only provide temporary relief. And how is your sleep? Are you sleeping well? Not really. I have trouble falling asleep and wake up feeling tired. Do you have a history of migraines or chronic headaches in your family? My mother had migraines, but I’ve never had them. Thank you for that information. Based on what you’ve told me, it seems like you might be experiencing tension headaches, probably worsened by screen time and lack of sleep. I recommend trying to reduce your screen time, especially in the evening, and see if that helps. I will also prescribe a mild pain reliever that should be more effective. If your symptoms persist, we may need to do additional tests. Does that sound okay to you? Yes, that works for me. Thank you. You’re welcome. Take care, and we’ll follow up in a week to see how you’re doing. Thank you. I’ll see you next week. Have a good day, Ms. Smith."
